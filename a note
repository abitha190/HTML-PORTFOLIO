A NOTE TO ONESELF 

Since no one said this to me., or is anyone out there wanna here is, 

first of all am wondering the answer to this question as many of them wanted the answer too from mee, 

'As a 21 year old girl should think alot abou life or life lessons or life decisions', FINE whatever the answeer might be, As most of them might figured out whats exactly they wanted from this life, or some of them was really happy to go with their flow of life , as life offered them the right way and there are some of like me who actually wanted to hear something deeply as they wanted to here it from certain people eventhough we heard from the insta feeds  but still as  they didn't makes to feel, so I just wanna tell myself or some of like me, " that we may wish whatever in this journey of life, and we may plan everything but the thing is that this life has so many suspenses that sometimes breaks or fulfills our heart in a different way.But whatever happened , as everyone says past is past you cannot change move on with that,, though this resembeles the reality but We cannot able to accept that harsh reality since every part of us keep clinging to the past and that past doesn't buries but evolves everytime as a fire.BUT whatever happened, A NOTE TO ONESELF IS THAT,, " ONLY U KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE FACED, ONLY YOU KNOW HOW EVERYTHING MAKES YOU FEEL RIGHT NOW AS NO ONE SAID TO ME,,, That be happy for how far you came as everytime  your heart fights the battle between you and this reality, you are enough and you are okay with the slow transition change of your life, and no one is permanent in this changing world,and you are enough eventhough you didn't know what others know and you okay with ur messy thoughtful nature unless you hurt anyone. AS nothing is constant and nothing lies in our hands being in the moment is what important...
